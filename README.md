## NYC Taxi Trip Duration Analysis

This project is based on the Kaggle competition "NYC Taxi Trip Duration" ([link to competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/overview)). The competition provides a spatial-temporal dataset that records detailed information about taxi trips in New York City, including:

- **Pickup and dropoff locations** (latitude and longitude)  
- **Timestamps** for pickup and dropoff events  
- **Trip duration** (target variable to predict)  
- **Additional features** such as passenger count and vendor information  

### Objective  

The goal of the project is to analyze and model the taxi trip duration using spatio-temporal data. This involves exploring and visualizing patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, as well as implementing predictive modeling techniques to estimate trip durations.  

1. **Spatial Analysis**:
   - Investigating geographic patterns in pickup and dropoff locations.  
   - Identifying high-demand zones and their temporal variations.  

2. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Understanding temporal patterns, such as peak hours, days, and seasonal trends.  
   - Correlating trip duration with time-based features like time of day and day of the week.  

3. **Spatio-Temporal Patterns**:
   - Combining spatial and temporal factors to uncover complex dependencies.  
   - Visualizing pickup-dropoff pairs and their impact on trip duration.
